# CNN_ABCsteppe

scripts from Rincon-Barrado et al. "Micro and macroevolution in the Rand Flora pattern: new advances in analytical tools integrating phylogenomics and phylogeography", to simulate and compare genetic datasets of two species from the Canary islands under different demographic scenarios. Data under the selected model for each species was also used to perform parameter estimation. Both model comparison and parameter estimation were achieved by training a CNN, from which prediction were then used as Summary Statistics (SuSt) for ABC.
