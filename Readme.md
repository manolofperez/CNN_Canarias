# CNN_ABCsteppe

scripts from Rincon-Barrado et al. "Micro and macroevolution in the Rand Flora pattern: new advances in analytical tools integrating phylogenomics and phylogeography", to simulate and compare genetic datasets from five steppe species under three different demographic models. Data under the selected model for each species was also used to perform parameter estimation. Both model comparison and parameter estimation were achieved by training a CNN, form which prediction were then used as Summary Statistics (SuSt) for ABC.
